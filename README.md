# IS4310-ISO485M6
Isolated RS485 Modbus RTU Slave Module with RJ45

## Presentation
The IS4310-ISO485M6 is a ready-to-operate module integrating the Modbus RTU Slave stack chip IS4310 with an isolated RS485 Transceiver. This solution reduces to the minimum expression the design effort of integrating a Modbus RTU Slave with an isolated RS485 electrical interface.

The module is daisy-chained: it integrates two RJ45 connectors with the standard Modbus pinout.

The module can be directly soldered to your PCB with its castellated holes, or you can solder a pin header and use it as a module.

### Isolation Benefits
Isolation is a good solution for industrial environments with long-distance cables, significant ground potential differences between devices, or high electrical noise.
